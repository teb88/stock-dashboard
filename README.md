# Stock Market Dashboard

This is a fun challenge project I'm building to explore various technologies.

**Tech Stack:**

- Vite with Typescript for a solid foundation
- Joy UI for a delightful user interface experience (first time using it!)
- React Query (Tanstack) for efficient data fetching and synchronization
- React Router v6 for seamless single-page application routing
- TradeView Lightweight Charts for interactive and performant financial visualizations

**Check out the live demo!**
